# Double-Pendulum-Simulation
This project is a simulation of a double pendulum. It solves the equations of motion numerically and then animates a double pendulum according to those solutions.

Features:

Set mass of bobs, initial angles, length of arms and gravitational acceleration value.

Trace path of second bob (note: I couldn't figure out how to make it clear the drawings, so if you want to do that you'll just have to restart the program.

Choose between Euler's Method and Runge-Kutte for solving the differential equations

I'm not sure how much I trust my implementation of Runge-Kutte, but everything looked more or less ok.
